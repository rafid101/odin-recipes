    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Blackout cake is a moist and tender cake with deep cocoa flavor. Layers of chocolate cake are filled with light and airy chocolate pudding, then all of this goodness is enrobed in a rich chocolate ganache. This is a dream dessert: chocolate on chocolate on chocolate.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup whole buttermilk, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the cake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat 3 (9-inch) round cake pans with cooking spray; line bottoms of each cake pan with parchment paper, and spray parchment lightly with cooking spray. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl until no lumps remain.</li>
        <li>Combine buttermilk, canola oil, eggs, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat on medium-low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Reduce speed to low, and gradually beat in flour mixture until just combined, 1 to 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed. With mixer on low speed, slowly stream in hot coffee, beating until just incorporated, about 1 minute. Divide batter evenly among the prepared cake pans, about 2 cups each.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs, about 18 minutes. Let cakes cool completely in cake pans on a wire rack, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>While cake cools, prepare filling: Whisk together pudding mix and heavy cream until mostly smooth and slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Chill, covered, until fully set, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
